      "details": "Do you want to use your data to make predictions about the future? This training supports you in doing that. To do this, machine learning is the process of creating, evaluating, and implementing predictive algorithms. Before going into these machine learning topics, make sure you are familiar with course 3 of this specialization. This course will build on Course 3 by giving students an overview of a variety of additional machine learning ideas, methods, and algorithms, from fundamental classification to decision trees and clustering. You will learn how to use, evaluate, and understand machine learning algorithms as an alternate approach to answering your research questions by finishing this course."

For applications such as detecting known models in images, depth recovery from stereo, camera calibration, image stabilization, automatic alignment (e.g. panoramas), tracking, and action identification, we'll create the fundamental techniques. We pay less attention to the machine learning component of CV since that is truly best learnt in an ML course since it is classification theory."
